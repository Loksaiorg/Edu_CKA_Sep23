	Kubernetes is a Open Source Container Orchestration Tool.
	
	DevOps and its Stages :::
	
		Containers ???
		
		Virtual Machines ???
		
	Devops :::
	
		Is a software development strategy
	
		Development ::
			--> Create the source Code
			--> Build 
					--> It is a process of compiling the source code & Create artifacts (binary - *.war/*.jar/*.dll/*.exec)
					
						mywebapp.war	dependencies!
						tomcat_Server_v8.5 with jdk_Openjdk11
						
						Package : mywebapp_pkg1(mywebapp.war,tomcat_v8.5,Openjdk11)
						
						Application_Image 	: 	It is static file which defines the Application and its dependencies.
												Non-Executable.
											
						Container		 	:	Container is a executable units of Application_Images		
					
		Deployed to higher environments:
			
			Test Environments 
				QA 					mywebapp.war - tomcat_Server_v9 with jdk_Openjdk17
									mywebapp_pkg1
				UAT 
					
			Prod Environment
				PROD Server
				
		
		
		Monolith Application Architecture.
				Tightly coupled
		
		Micro_Service Based
				Loosely coupled
		
		
		E_Commerce Portals :::
		
		www.amazon.com - It is a Web Application.
		
		
		Sign_up			--> Developer - src_Code change 	- Test - Independently deploy the changes to prod
											mywebapp_pkg1 --> 
		Sign_In
		Search
		Add_to_Cart
		Place_the_Order
		Make_Payment
		Confirm_Order
		Track
		
			If this is Monolith Application Architecture, we consider all these as Modules/Functions
		
			In Micro_Service Based Application Architecture, we consider all these as services 
			
			Containerized Applications :::
				It is recommended to have Micro_Service Based Application Architecture
				
			3-tier Application Architecture. 
				Front_end 						User Interface
				Application_Logic
				Back_End(Database)

			Kubernetes is one of the Open Source Container Orchestration Tools. 	

			Architecture of Kubernetes ::

					Kubernetes is a Master / Nodes Architecture.
					
					
				Kubernetes_Master :: (VM)					
					Kubernetes_Worker_Node1 (VM)
					Kubernetes_Worker_Node2 (VM)	

			Terminologies :::
			
				Images 				==> Just a static file that defines the application artifacts & its Dependencies
				
				Containers 			==> Containers are the executable units of Images.
				
				Container Registry	==> It is used to store & manage the images.	dockerhub
				
				Repository			==> It is a subset of Container Registry. 

				Kubeadm 			==> It is a Command line utility to install and Manage the Kubernetes Master & Nodes.

				Kubectl				==> It is a command line utility used to interact with Kubernetes 
				
				Kubernetes_Cluster	==> It is collection of Kubernetes_Worker_Nodes	
								
				POD

**************************
Day - 3 - 30th Sep. 2023
**************************	

		Working with Kubernetes Core Concepts :::
		
		Namespace ::::
			It is logical partitioning of the the Kubernetes Cluster.
			
		
		POD :::
		
			Create the Pod using kubectl command .
			
			Login to that pod and access the application. 
			
			Sevices - NodePort.
			

			Create the Pod using kubectl command .
			
				Manifest file :::
				 
				 Config file written using *.yaml script.
				 
				 
				Create the Manifest file :::
				
				kubectl command to create the object.
				
				kubectl create -f <file1.yaml>
				
				kubectl get pods 
				
				kubectl describe command 			### This is basically used to analyse the kubernetes objects
			

			Login to that pod and access the application. 
			
				docker exec -it <container_id>			# in Docker.
				
				
				kubectl exec -it  
				
				How to access the web applications running inside the container ???
				
				by using the container port. 
				
				<external_ip>:<hostport_#> 
				
				Port mapping  / port binding in Docker ???
				
				docker run -it -p 8089:8080 tomcat
				
				
				Service : NodePort 
				
			Kubernetes Controller Objects:
				Replication Controller 
				Replicasets
				Daemonsets 
				Deployments	


			Pod --> nginx-pod.


			Kubernetes Controller Objects:				
				Replication Controller  & Replicasets::
					Both are used to run a specific copy of pods at any point of time.
					Replicasets - Is the latest Object which support many features of Kubernetes.
					Replicaset uses ==> Set based operator and equality based operator to identify the object labels.
					Replication Controller ==> Uses only the equality based operator to identify the object labels.
					Scale-Up
					Scale-Down										
				
				replicas 3 --> 
				
			Daemonsets	:::
			
				Daemonset is used to deploy a copy of pod in all the available/set of worker nodes.
				While monitoring the worker_nodes/Applications.
				Logs 
				Reports 
				
			Deployment Object :::
			
			
				*.war ==> MyappImg_v1.0	==> Published to Dockerhub. Kubernetes we deploy this appln.
				*.war ==> MyappImg_v1.1	==> Published to Dockerhub. Kubernetes we deploy this appln.

				
				Deployment Controller Object is used to deploy/upgrade/rollback/scale_up/Scale-Down the pods without any downtime.
				
				Replicas: 100
				
				My_Appln_Pod ::: 100 replicas. MyappImg_v1.0
				
				
				Deployment Strategy ::::
				
				- Rolling Update : 	Is the default deployment strategy in kubernetes deployment
									It is used to perform the deployment without any downtime.
									
									
				
				My_Appln_Pod ::: 100 replicas. MyappImg_v1.0 ==>  upgrade to ==> MyappImg_v1.1
				
				3 copies of pod --- is up and running. MyappImg_v1.0 
				
				update 1 of 3, if it is successful, It go with next
				update 2 of 3 
				update 3 of 3

Day - 4 - 1st Oct. 2023

				Deployment Controller Object :::
				
				deployment failure ::::
				
					during deployment there will no be any downtime, even if the deployment failed.
				
				Volumes:
					Persistant Volume - PV 
					Persistant Volume Claim - PVC 
					Hostpath Volume 
					Empty Dir 
					Config_Maps 
					Secrets
					
					
				Container Volumes ::::
				
				Container Volume ::::
				
					Stateless Applications :
						Applications that will never have the trace of execution.
					
					Stateful Applications :
						Applications that leaves the trace of execution in the form of logs, reports, any outfiles.
						Also, this might expect inputs from external applications
					
					3-tier Application :::
					
					E_Commerce 
					
						sign-in ==> micro-service ==> 
										Front_end				c1/pod
										Application_Logic		c2/pod
										Back_End (Database)		c3/pod
										
					
				Kubernetes :::
				
					Volumes :::
						Persistant Volume - PV 
						Persistant Volume Claim - PVC 
						Host Volume 
						Empty Dir 
						Config_Maps 
						Secrets
						
				
					Config_Maps :::
					
						Application Pod :::
						
							need some input --> can be passed in the form of input files.
							
							The volumes that are needed to any pod, should be created at cluster level.
							
						KMaster 
							KWN1,2,3,4,5,6
							
						
					
					Secrets
					
					
					Deploy an application in QA Environment ==> 
					
							application.config.properties_qa
							application.config.properties_uat
							application.config.properties_prod
							
					Application Image::
					
					
					1. Create a config file 
					2. Create a config_map using tis file.
					3. Create pod by attaching this config map
					
					
					Config_Maps (vs) Secret
					
						- Config_Maps volumes are used to send the general inputs to the pod
						- Secret volumes are used to send the sensitive inputs to the pod
					
					Persistant Volume - PV 
					Persistant Volume Claim - PVC 
					Host Volume 
					
					
					Volume ==> it is just a directory(files)
					
					Pod ==> Application ==> generate some output files ==> 2GB of volume 
					
					Storage Administrator /Infra-Team :::

					Persistant Volume - PV 
					
					Persistant Volume Claim - PVC 
					
							Static / Dynamic --> 
							

					Host Volume  ==> 

						Pod = deployed in a worknode!
						
						Host volumes are created in the host machine.
						
				
				Namespace :::
				
					- It is a logical partitioning of Kubernetes Cluster.
					
					kubectl get ns
					
					kubectl create ns <ns_name>
					
					
				Kubernetes_Master					# Non-Prod
					WN1,WN2,WN3,WN4,WN5				# DEV/QA/UAT


				Kubernetes_Master	
					Kubernetes_Master					# Production
